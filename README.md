# Scuffed Search

Welcome to Scuffed Search, where we embrace the chaos in search of your elusive data. It's like finding a needle in a haystack, but with more fun and less hay!

## Description

Scuffed Search is a command-line tool designed for the brave souls who dare to search through the abyss of their file systems. Built for use in Visual Studio Code's terminal, it leverages the power of C and multithreading to scour your directories, leaving no stone unturned.

## Features

- **Multithreaded Magic**: Harnesses the power of multithreading to speed through searches.
- **Real-Time Discovery**: Watch in real-time as occurrences are found â€“ it's like a treasure hunt!
- **Result Storage**: Stores the results of the search in a CSV file, neatly organizing the findings.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Automatically removes duplicates from the results, ensuring clean and usable data.
- **VS Code Integration**: Crafted for seamless use within the VS Code terminal.
- **TDM-GCC Compiled**: Built using the mighty TDM-GCC compiler for Windows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- TDM-GCC Compiler
- C/C++ Compile Run extension for VS Code

### Installation

1. **Download the Project**
   - Visit the [Scuffed Search GitHub repository](https://github.com/SilviaMun/ScuffedSearch).
   - Click on the `Code` button and select `Download ZIP`.
   - Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.

2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**
   - Navigate to the extracted directory.
   - Right-click and select "Open with Visual Studio Code".

3. **Install TDM-GCC Compiler**
   - Download TDM-GCC from [TDM-GCC's official site](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/).
   - Follow the installation instructions to set up the compiler on your system.

4. **Install C/C++ Compile Run Extension in VS Code**
   - In VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar.
   - Search for "C/C++ Compile Run" and install the extension.

5. **Compile the Program**
   - Open the source file in VS Code.
   - Use the shortcut (`Ctrl+Alt+C` to compile and `Ctrl+Alt+R` to run) or right-click and select "Compile & Run" from the context menu.
   - A new folder will be created in your project directory containing the compiled program.

### Important Note

Due to the nature of file system operations performed by Scuffed Search, some antivirus software may flag the compiled executable. To ensure Scuffed Search runs smoothly, you may need to:

- **Sign the Executable**: If you have a code signing certificate, sign the compiled executable to avoid any antivirus warnings.
- **Disable Antivirus Temporarily**: If signing is not an option, you may need to temporarily disable your antivirus software while running Scuffed Search.

### Usage

1. Open the VS Code terminal.
2. Run the compiled program from the newly created folder.
3. Enter the directory path and the search string as prompted.
4. The CSV file with the search results will be created in the same folder as the compiled program.
